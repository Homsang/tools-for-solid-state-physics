# tools-for-soild-state-physics

It contains some simple tools for calculating common physical quantities in solid state physics, and is updated from time to time.

## 

The developer of this project is an undergraduate student from the School of Physics, **Nanjing University**, and the project will mainly include some calculation tools for some common physical quantities encountered in learning solid state physics. These tools may be presented in more advanced forms elsewhere, but are often integrated into more complex programs that are difficult for beginners to use. Here, the `python` language is used to show each small function independently, without requiring a very complicated installation. You can read every little piece of code very easily, and it's often very exploitable and portable. 

If you are interested in this project, welcome to cooperate with me. My email is [homsangcn@gmail.com](homsangcn@gmail.com). I believe we will gain more.

Tools that have been developed include:
- Calculation of crystal Madelung constant
